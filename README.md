Modification of "Simulating the Pen" demo. Changes include:
- Combined smoothing and variable thickness
- Smoothing is done while you draw, not after
- Thickness is gradiated for smoother lines
- A single click creates a drawn point
- Ink will "pool" if you hold a location too long
- Ink splattering can occur for quick, hard turns
